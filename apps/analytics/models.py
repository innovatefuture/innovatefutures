# HOW THIS WORKS
#
# when an event that we want to record for analytic purposes occurs, a corresponding function in the LOGGING FUNCTIONS section should be invoked.
# this can happen either by catching a signal (as shown in the case of log_login) or simply by calling the function from whatever bit of code is
# responsible for making the event to be logged happen (as with eg. log_signup in the save function of CustomSignupForm in userauth/forms.py).
# these functions are responsible for recording the relevant information as an AnalyticsEvent, specifying who did what and when.
# the logging functions are very simple, but they are written here rather than in the places they get invoked from to ensure we know in a single place
# what events are logged and how.

#
# LOGGING FUNCTIONS
#


# we take request as an argument so that we can log the session if that turns out later to be necessary
# this is also why we can't hook a post_save signal for this, it doesn't have access to the request
